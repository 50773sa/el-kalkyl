This is an ongoing (CRUD) hobby project used to test new techniques, hence it's not entirely thought out. The design has also changed over time... A little here and there, as they say.

Nevertheless, the web app is fully functional and serves as a tool for a professional electrician. It helps to smoothly calculate the materials and time required before creating a quote for the customer.

The app is currently in Swedish but will later be translated into English with Swedish as an option.

### Languages and tools used:

<ul>
  <li>Reactjs</li>
  <li>MaterialUI</li>
  <li>Firebase Firestore</li>
  <li>React Hook Form</li>
  <li>...and a bit of Zustand, etc</li>
</ul>
